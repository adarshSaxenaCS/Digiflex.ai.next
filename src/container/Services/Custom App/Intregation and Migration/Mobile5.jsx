            The e-learning platform provides STEM-focused courses and tech camps
            for a deeper education in technology for school students. The
            platform is supported by education and technology experts from the
            Harvard Graduate School of Education and the MIT Media Lab, making
            it a perfect synthesis of education and STEM. Mindbowser augmented
            the development efforts by providing a technology team that worked
            directly with the CTO to accelerate development efforts.
